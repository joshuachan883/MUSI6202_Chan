Question 3 
Part 4
The frequency resolution is about 21.533Hz

Part 5
(I am not really sure what the phrasing of the question, but I can say this) As long as the window 
Length (currently 2048) does not change, and the sampling frequency (currently 44100) does not change
, then there is no change in the frequency resolution.
